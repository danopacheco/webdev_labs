    <h1> Dublin </h1>
    ... 
    <p> As the city continued to prosper during the 18th century, <em>Georgian Dublin</em> became, for a short period, the second largest city of the British Empire and the fifth largest city in Europe, with the population exceeding <sup>130,000.</sup> While some medieval streets and layouts (including the areas around Temple Bar, Aungier Street, Capel Street and Thomas Street) were less affected by the wave of Georgian reconstruction, much of Dublin's architecture href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" Ireland and layout dates from this period.[40][41]

   <p> Dublin grew even more dramatically during the 18th century, 
   with the construction of many new districts and buildings, such as Merrion Square,
   Parliament House and the Royal Exchange. The Wide Streets Commission was established in 1757 
   at the request of Dublin Corporation to govern architectural standards on the layout of streets, bridges and buildings. 
   In 1759, the Guinness brewery was founded; and would eventually grow to become the largest brewery in the world and the largest employer in Dublin.[42][43]
